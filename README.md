#  Tai-Ahom Manuscripts Digitization & Translation

##  Overview
This project is part of our **B.Tech CSE Final Year** work.  
We aim to **digitize, preserve, and translate** endangered **Tai-Ahom manuscripts** using:

-  **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** → To convert scanned manuscripts into digital text.  
-  **Machine Translation (MT)** → To translate from **Ahom → Assamese → English**.  
-  **Web Portal** → To make manuscripts accessible online.

##  Features (Planned)
- **Data Collection & Cleanup** → Extract, preprocess, and annotate manuscripts.  
- **OCR** → Fine-tune Tesseract/TrOCR for Ahom script recognition.  
- **Machine Translation** → Build parallel corpus and fine-tune MT models.  
- **Web Portal** → Upload manuscripts → OCR → Translate → Save results.  
- **Evaluation** → Measure OCR (CER) and MT (BLEU/chrF) scores.

⸻

 Next Steps
	•	Manual transcription for ground truth (data/gt/).
	•	Fine-tune Tesseract OCR on Ahom script.
	•	Build translation corpus (Ahom → Assamese → English).
	•	Setup web portal for user interaction.
	•	Weekly progress documentation.
