50 From Dust to Digital
Having decided on this reading for men, the first draft translation assumed
that nang was a verb meaning “sit”, which is certainly one of its possible
meanings, along with “back”, “extend”, “lady”, “loud”, “be like” and “nose”.
Chaichuen then assumed that the phrase ru ba, which in Example 3 follows
nang, would be a location, and proposed on the “top of the shoulder”.
Syntactically this would have to mean that the long-headed Hill Tribal was
sitting there.
Example 3)
miNq rU rI n[q rU ba /
men ru ri nang ru ba
Hill Tribal head long sit head shoulder
“The long headed Hill Tribals sit on the shoulder”.
Example 4)
miNq n; c; n[q linq k[q /
men na cha nang lin kang
Hill Tribal face bad sit plain middle
“The bad faced Hill Tribals sit in the middle of the plain”.
Since these two lines should relate to the location where the spirit was, these
translations were plainly not satisfactory. At the time of this work, the research
team were staying in Parijat, which is where the manuscript is kept. Chaichuen
excitedly came in one morning, having thought about the translation over
night, with the suggestion that nang should be read as “like”, and that these
two lines were thus similes. With this in mind, we could translate Example
3 as “[The spirit is] with the long headed Hill Tribals whose heads are like
dogs”, reading the last word ma as “dog”. This involves reading the first
letter of that word, the last in Example 3, as having initial m rather than
m-
initial b. In many manuscripts, such as Ming Mvng Lung Phai, these two
b-
letters are not distinguished.
After listening to Chaichuen’s suggestion, I then suggested that reading
ma as “horse” made even more sense — the heads of horses being long —
and thus both lines were re-translated as similes describing the Tai Ahom
referring to the headdresses of the Naga people on the India-Myanmar border.
