together with other members of the research team and also with several

This translation method, while probably the most reliable, was also
exceptionally time consuming and expensive, requiring the physical presence

I translate the Shan into English; then Chaichuen and I meet, discuss and

including a gloss in Shan as well as English, as we will see below in Example
