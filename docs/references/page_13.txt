Apart from the sasi bark, cloth and paper manuscripts, the Ahom script was
also used on brass plates, coins17 and some inscriptions on stone, the most
famous of which is the Snake Pillar at Guwahati Museum.18 We did not
photograph any examples of these. In the manuscripts that we did photograph,
17 The inscriptions on the coins are usually in Sanskrit or Persian, but a very small number
have inscriptions in the Ahom script. The coins are comprehensively listed in Anup
Mitra, Coins of the Ahom Kingdom (Calcutta: Mahua Mitra, 2001). Mitra lists a coin of
King Pramataa Simha (Sunenpha) (1744-1751) as an example of a coin with a Tai Ahom
inscription (p. 76,).
