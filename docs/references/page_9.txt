Before taking the photographs, a good deal of time was needed to organise
the manuscripts at every site so that they were photographed in page
order, whenever possible (see below for a more in depth discussion of the
issues involved in page ordering). For example, in one house we found one
complete text (which was probably a nineteenth-century copy of a text not
yet photographed anywhere else), and all the older manuscripts arranged
by the owner into two groups. But these two groups turned out to be parts
of at least six different manuscripts, and portions of the two largest of these
were found in each of the two groups. None of them were complete, and so
before we could photograph them, it was essential to group them as best we
could, a process that took a great deal more time than the photography itself.
