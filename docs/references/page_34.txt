who is related to the king, one term for whom is khai pha (“the egg of the
sky”). So while we know the name of this manuscript because it is explicitly
stated, we will not know what that means until the whole text has been
studied. The story of this manuscript is about a river creature, or Naga, and
a man, referred to as “the single man”, who casts his fishing net over the
river and accidentally catches that Naga.59

59 There is another manuscript, EAP373_SandicharanPhukan_OdbhutKakhotNangKhai,
which shares the name Nang Khai. We have not been able to compare the two texts to
see if there is any similarity. In March 2014, we photographed yet another manuscript
in fragments, also entitled Nang Khai (EAP373_ DhamenMohanBoruah_NangKhai), but
once again we have not been able to connect the text of that version to the version of
Baparam Hati Baruah.
