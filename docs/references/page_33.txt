58 From Dust to Digital
Stories
In addition to the Buddhist stories mentioned earlier, there are a number of
Tai stories whose storyline is not necessarily known from other sources and
whose translation is thus more challenging. One example of these is the Nang
Khai story, from a manuscript owned by the late Baparam Hati Baruah of Hati
Gaon (Fig. 2.9).57 The manuscript, one of the first photographed in the project,
has the name of the copyist, and the name of the text, but no date. On fol 20v
(image 0042) it is written: “In the seventh month, his father who was Serela
Baruah and his son Mekheli, he wrote this Nang Khai scripture which should
not be allowed to disappear, should not be hidden [lest] you fall into the forks
of hell”. The name of the manuscript is given as [Nang Khai Puthi],
n[ qx jpUvI
where puthi is an Assamese word meaning “sacred text”. Altogether there
are 37 folios in this text, and so it is curious that the scribe gave his name only
a little over half way through. Although we have not yet finished translating
the whole text, it does appear to be one story; perhaps in writing his name in
the middle of the text, the copyist was confused about the contents.

Since the translation of the manuscript is not yet complete,58 we do not yet
know the meaning of “nang khai”. It could be “lady egg”, referring to a lady
57 Baparam Hati Baruah passed away in 2014 before the translation of his manuscript could
be completed and presented to him. His house was one of very few Ahom houses that
maintained the Tai tradition of building on stilts, but with the special feature that the
bamboo floors on the upper level were rendered with mud. This manuscript is archived
as EAP373_BaparamHatiBaruah_NangKhai_0001 to 0078.tif.
58 We hope this will be completed in early 2015.
