The same entity is found in the Sai Kai manuscript in the line that immediately
follows Example 9, presented here as Example 11:
Example 11)

“He made the first daughter, the big one, after she died
she became the ground directly under” (EAP373_ Padma
SangBunPhukan_SaiKai1_0004).
Both the Ai Seng Lau prayer and the Sai Kai manuscript have the same phrase
to refer to this deity, ji nang luk nying khiuw (the first daughter, the big one).
In the Sai Kai manuscript, it goes on after Example 11 to refer to the three
younger sisters of ji, namely i (second daughter), am (third daughter) and ai
(fourth daughter). These four words occurring in the same position in four
successive lines confirm for us the reading that we have given in Example 11.
This brief discussion of Ahom prayers has been presented to show the
relationship between these manuscripts and the living tradition of Ahom prayers.
The similarity between the Ai Seng Lau prayer and the Sai Kai manuscripts
confirms that the language of those prayers is not the “Pseudo Ahom language”
that Terwiel has suggested was in use for some Ahom rituals.56 It remains
possible that the prayers such as Ai Seng Lau have been newly created after
studying the manuscripts, although members of the Tai Ahom priestly caste
specifically say that this prayer has been handed down from father to son over
many generations, though without knowing the full meaning of the prayer.
What we can say is that the close study of the manuscripts has allowed for a
translation of the prayers that are in use in contemporary ritual to be undertaken.
