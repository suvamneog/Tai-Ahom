32 From Dust to Digital
and cataloguing Ahom manuscripts, and archiving the resulting digital
materials at the British Library; by archiving digital photographs with our
partners at the Institute for Tai Studies and Research (Moran, India), Gauhati
University (Guwahati, India) and Dibrugarh University (Dibrugarh, India);
and by making images and metadata universally available online through
the Center for Research in Computational Linguistics, where they will be
integrated with existing search tools developed under the Ahom Lexicography
project2 and the Tai and Tibeto-Burman languages of Assam website.3
Between October 2011 and the middle of 2014, the project photographed
411 manuscripts owned by around fifty different persons — a total of nearly
15,000 images. All materials will be available online through the EAP website
in combination with basic metadata. Around twenty different manuscripts
have been transcribed, of which around ten have been translated in full or
in part.4
The methodology of the project followed these steps:
• Locating the manuscripts
• Seeking permission from the owners for them to be copied
• Cleaning and ordering the manuscripts
• Photography
• Data management
• Metadata preparation
• Transcription
• Translation and revision of metadata
While it may seem obvious that the photographing, archiving and long-term
preservation of these manuscripts is a good idea, this has not always been
apparent to the manuscript owners, who are members of the Tai Ahom
priestly caste. Not all of them have allowed us to take photographs for a
variety of reasons. For example, there is a belief among some of some of the
priestly families that the knowledge contained in the manuscripts should
