Ahom manuscripts is a challenging task, and in this section we will detail
the reasons for that, which are related to the structure of the Tai language.
Tai languages are tonal, and most words are single syllables (monosyllables)
consisting of up to five elements:35 an optional initial consonant; an optional
second consonant (/y/, /r/, /w/); a vowel; a tone; and an optional final consonant
(/ŋ/, /n/ or /m/), written followed by a virama,36 or a second vowel (/i/, /ɯ/ or
/u/). The traditional Tai scripts used in Northeast India and most of Myanmar
did not mark all the vowel distinctions, and did not mark tone at all.37 Some
examples of Ahom words are given in Example 2, with their pronunciation
and an explanation of each symbol.38
Example 2 king k i ng virama
ki[q
krit k r i t virama
kRitq
kai k ai
kj
There are several differences between this kind of writing system and
the alphabetic system used in the Roman script. First of all, the vowels,
exemplified here by /i/, are written as diacritics to the consonant, in the case
of /i/ as an oval shaped symbol above the consonant. Secondly, where there
is a consonant cluster, as in the word krit, the second consonant is written
as an attachment to the initial consonant. Standing by itself, /r/ is written as
, but as the second consonant in a cluster it takes a different form.
r
All written syllables in Tai Ahom and related languages can be pronounced
in a number of ways with a range of meanings. Consider again the first word
in Example 2, which it is suggested was pronounced /king/. We cannot be
sure that it was not /keng/ or /kɛng/. Several of the spoken languages closely
related to Tai Ahom (Shan, Khamti, Tai Phake) have nine distinct vowels (and
35 There are different linguistic theoretical frameworks for the presentation of the elements
within a syllable. In one theoretical framework, all vowel initial words are actually
preceded by a glottal stop [ʔ], and this is represented in writing by A in the Ahom script.
In our analysis, the glottal stop is not a phoneme of Tai Ahom, and vowel initial syllables
are permitted. For further discussion, see Morey, The Tai Languages of Assam, p. 111.
36 This is the word given to a sign indicating that a consonant has no following vowel.
Consonants without it can be interpreted as being followed by /a/. It is called sāt in Tai
Phake.

38 We use a digraph <ng> rather than the IPA symbol /ŋ/ to mark the velar nasal. This is
because we are using only Roman letters to transcribe the Ahom script in our work,
to make it easier for the members of the Ahom community to interpret the linguistic
materials.
