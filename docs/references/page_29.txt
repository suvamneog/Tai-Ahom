“The God who is like many knives, the God who is a knife,
we pray to you, who are the creator of the sky, the peak of the
heaven, oh my Lord”.
There are a number of difficulties in translating this prayer. The first of these
is the translation of the word bit, which can also be read as mit. Here we
have translated it as “knife”, but there is another Ahom word mit, attested
in the Bar Amra lexicon with the meaning “rainbow”. If we take this as the
meaning of mit, we would read lai mit as “pattern of the rainbow”, which is
a plausible meaning here.
Example 8 is part of a longer prayer that is frequently used in Tai Ahom
rituals. While we have not found this exact phrase in a manuscript, we have
found references to a similar passage in manuscripts such as the Sai Kai text
for which there are several versions. The one shown below (Fig. 2.8) belongs
to Chau Padma Sangbun Phukan of Amguri, but we have also consulted two
additional copies belonging to Tileshwar Mohan,55 the owner of the Ming
Mvng Lung Phai manuscript. None of these manuscripts have the dates of
copying, or information about the copyist. None of them is complete, but
55 These will be archived as EAP373_TileshwarMohan_SaiKai_0001 to 0032.tif and
