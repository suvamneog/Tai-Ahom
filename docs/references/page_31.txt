56 From Dust to Digital
Returning to Example 8, the second line contains a number of Buddhist terms:
phura (Buddha), tara (teaching of the Buddha or dharma), along (Bodhisattva,
previous incarnation of the Buddha), sikkya (Sakya, creator God in the Buddhist
texts) and nipan (Nirvana, the state of enlightenment). The presence of these
terms in the prayer suggests Buddhist influence on the Tai Ahom rituals.
Chaichuen has suggested that these words can be interpreted as replacing
original Tai expressions, as we see in Table 2.1:

A few lines later in the Ai Seng Lau prayer, we see the following, in which
a deity or entity called ji (first daughter) is invoked, as seen in Example 10:
