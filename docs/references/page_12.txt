For the modern day Tai Ahom community, these manuscripts represent a
link to their long history, commencing with the arrival of King Siukapha in
1228 AD. From at least the late nineteenth century and throughout the early
twentieth century, members of the Tai Ahom priestly caste continued copying
the manuscripts,16 but although a small number of manuscripts are still copied
onto sasi bark, in most of the collections that we have been able to study and
photograph, the later manuscripts are written on paper. This paper was usually
of a much poorer quality than the bark, as can be seen in the image below (Fig.
2.3). Most of the paper manuscripts are probably not as important as the old
bark manuscripts, from the point of view of the texts they contain at least, but
we have photographed them when possible. Sometimes they contain versions
of texts that are incomplete in the bark manuscripts, and when eventually
these are studied in detail, the paper manuscripts may become invaluable.
house for photographing.
16 We cannot be sure that the tradition of manuscript copying was continuous throughout
the nineteenth century, although members of the Tai Ahom priestly caste assured us
many times that they were. We can say with confidence, based on dates found in the
manuscripts, and information about the copyists, that there has been a continuous
tradition of copying texts since at least the late nineteenth century. For example, in some
cases the copyist was identified as the great-grandfather of the present owner, and, in
combination with the Lakni date, we could establish that the book was copied in the last
third of the nineteenth century.
