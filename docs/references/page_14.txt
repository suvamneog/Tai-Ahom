the copying date and the name and location of the copyist are often given,
occasionally together with the name of the manuscript.
The dates are usually in the sixty-year Lakni cycle, a calendrical cycle used
for both years and days. The Lakni cycle names the year by means of two series
of terms used in combination, as in Kat Kau. The first element, Kat is one of ten
words that are used in the first position, combining with the second element,
Kau, which is one of twelve terms used in second position.19 Altogether sixty
combinations are used and the cycle starts again after sixty years. With a Lakni
date alone, such as Kat Kau, we cannot tell if a manuscript was copied in 1805
or sixty years early in 1745, or even sixty years earlier than that. Sometimes
additional information is given and the date can be more certain. For example,
on line four of the last page of manuscript Khun Lung Khun Lai, owned by Tulsi
Phukan of Sibsagar district (Fig. 2.4), the date is given as Lakni era Kat Kau,
eighth month, in the time of King Kamaleshwar Singh (reigned 1795-1811).
Thus this particular Kat Kau year corresponds to 1805.20

the year 1805 corresponds to Kat Kau.
