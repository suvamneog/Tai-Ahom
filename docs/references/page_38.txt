Coda: a manuscript’s injunctions
Sometimes at the end of a manuscript, following the section containing the
name of the copyist and the date of the copying, there is an injunction from
the copyist about what should happen to the text. Example 14 is a line of
text from the end of the Khun Lung Khun Lai manuscript belonging to Tulsi
Phukan (see Fig. 2.4).
Example 14)
f] yonq y; h] rj lkq
phav jon ja hav rai lak
who beg proh give disappear steal
ၽႂ် ယွၼ်း ယႃႉ ႁႂ်ႈ ႁၢႆ လၵ်ႉ

ဝႆႉ သိူင်ႇ ယႃႉ ဢၢမ်း
“If someone begs [to take it] don’t give it lest it disappear, keep
it hidden, but don’t keep silent [about the story]”.
This translation was done by Chaichuen and myself, and the meaning
emerged after some discussion. The grammatical structure of this line is:
phav jon, ja hv rai lak, bai svng, ja am. The sentence consists of a condition
(phav jon “[if] someone begs [it]”), followed by three commands: ja hav
rai lak (“don’t let it be lost and taken away”), bai svng (“keep it hidden”
or perhaps “keep it safe”), and ja am (“don’t keep silent about it”). This
we interpret as a request to the future owners of the book to keep it in its
proper location, not to let it be taken away, keep it safe, but not to hide
its contents and meaning from the wider community. I consider that our
work is exactly in accord with this injunction.
